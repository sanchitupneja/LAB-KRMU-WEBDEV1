Simple JavaScript Quiz

Lab Assignment – KR Mangalam University Name: Sanchit Roll No: 2501730475

📌 Project Overview

This is a very basic JavaScript quiz program made for my lab assignment. The quiz runs in the browser console and asks a few simple questions . After each answer, it shows whether the answer is correct or not and finally displays the total score.

The code is kept simple on purpose so it looks like a normal human-written college assignment.
